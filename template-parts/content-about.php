                <h2>Dt. Gayatri Sabarad</h2>
                <p>Hey there, I am Gayatri, a practicing Clinical Dietitian by profession with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Food nutrition and dietetics. Knowing the mechanics of human body has been my passion, and what better than working with food to know the human body. As quotes by Thomas Edison, “The doctors of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs, but rather will cure and prevent disease with nutrition.” Food is what makes us. Health, as we all know is more precious than wealth.   It makes me so happy that more and more people are realizing the importance of health and wanting to make healthier food options, strive for a healthier lifestyle. Many food companies have noticed this change too, and have helped us all by developing multiple health products. These products are everywhere. All the ads on social media, television, posters in store. But here we are all so, so confused, wondering which one to pick, what to buy or should we even buy? I get sooo many questions by almost all of my clients, family and friends, “which product is good?”, “are they effective?”, “are they safe?”, “under what conditions should I use this products?”, “are they worth the price?” the questions never end.  So here I am to help all those who have such questions.  My blog is going to be all about health products, there uses, benefits, contra-indication, pros, cons, etc. All the information will be based on scientific research and my personal experience. I will try my best to give all my readers answers to all possible questions about different health products. This page is going to help all health enthusiast, and all those who have taken a step ahead to live a healthier life.  I’ll be very happy to read all your comments, suggestions, opinion, questions. If you want me to write about a specific product, please feel free to leave a comment below.  You can also email me your concerns or questions, to have a one to one conversation.  By the end of every post, I hope the picture in minds of my readers get much clearer and helps them make better decision for their health. </p>
